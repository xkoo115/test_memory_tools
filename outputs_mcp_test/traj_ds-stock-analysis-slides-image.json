If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Running and Interacting with Processes\n* Long running commands: For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`. For commands that need to run for a specific duration, like \"sleep\", you can set the \"timeout\" argument to specify a hard timeout in seconds.\n* Interact with running process: If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n",

If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n* The following binary file extensions can be viewed in Markdown format: [\".xlsx\", \".pptx\", \".wav\", \".mp3\", \".m4a\", \".flac\", \".pdf\", \".docx\"]. IT DOES NOT HANDLE IMAGES.\n* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file\n* If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>`\n* The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`\n* This tool can be used for creating and editing files in plain-text format.\n\n\nBefore using this tool:\n1. Use the view tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct (only applicable when creating new files):\n   - Use the view tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n\nWhen making edits:\n   - Ensure the edit results in idiomatic, correct code\n   - Do not leave the code in a broken state\n   - Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THIS TOOL:\n\n1. EXACT MATCHING: The `old_str` parameter must match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the file, including all whitespace and indentation. The tool will fail if `old_str` matches multiple locations or doesn't match exactly with the file content.\n\n2. UNIQUENESS: The `old_str` must uniquely identify a single instance in the file:\n   - Include sufficient context before and after the change point (3-5 lines recommended)\n   - If not unique, the replacement will not be performed\n\n3. REPLACEMENT: The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that replace the `old_str`. Both strings must be different.\n\nRemember: when making multiple file edits in a row to the same file, you should prefer to send all edits in a single message with multiple calls to this tool, rather than multiple messages with a single call each.\n",

Your first action MUST be to save the initial task (e.g., save_task_details(title='InitialTask', ...)). Also save your todo plan (e.g., save_task_details(title='MyTodoPlan', ...)).

Today I'll present our comprehensive stock analysis covering the past two years of performance data.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 2: Closing Prices Over Time\\n\\\"This chart shows our stock's closing price trend. We can observe the overall upward trajectory with some expected market volatility. Key points to note are the steady growth periods and the resilience during market corrections.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 3: Moving Average Analysis\\n\\\"Here we see the closing price with 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The 50-day MA tracks short-term trends while the 200-day MA shows long-term direction. The consistent positioning of the 50-day above the 200-day indicates sustained bullish momentum.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 4: Variable Correlation Analysis\\n\\\"The correlation matrix reveals expected strong relationships between different price variables. Of particular interest is the relationship between volume and price movements, which shows moderate correlation suggesting healthy trading activity.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 5: Daily Return Distribution & Risk\\n\\\"This distribution of daily returns helps us understand the stock's risk profile. While most returns cluster around zero, we see the characteristic fat tails common in equity markets.

Today I'll present our comprehensive stock analysis covering the past two years of performance data.\"\n\n## Slide 2: Closing Prices Over Time\n\"This chart shows our stock's closing price trend. We can observe the overall upward trajectory with some expected market volatility. Key points to note are the steady growth periods and the resilience during market corrections.\"\n\n## Slide 3: Moving Average Analysis\n\"Here we see the closing price with 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The 50-day MA tracks short-term trends while the 200-day MA shows long-term direction. The consistent positioning of the 50-day above the 200-day indicates sustained bullish momentum.\"\n\n## Slide 4: Variable Correlation Analysis\n\"The correlation matrix reveals expected strong relationships between different price variables. Of particular interest is the relationship between volume and price movements, which shows moderate correlation suggesting healthy trading activity.\"\n\n## Slide 5: Daily Return Distribution & Risk\n\"This distribution of daily returns helps us understand the stock's risk profile. While most returns cluster around zero, we see the characteristic fat tails common in equity markets. This informs our risk management strategies.\"\n\n## Slide 6: Trading Volume Analysis\n\"Volume analysis shows consistent trading interest with periodic spikes. These volume surges often correspond to earnings announcements or market-moving events, indicating efficient price discovery.\"\n\n## Slide 7: Key Findings & Recommendations\n\"In summary, our analysis reveals:\n- Strong long-term growth trajectory\n- Healthy technical indicators\n- Manageable risk profile\n- Sustained market interest\n\nWe recommend continued strategic investment with regular monitoring of these key metrics.\"\n\n## Q&A Preparation\nBe prepared to discuss:\n- Specific volatility events\n- Comparison with industry peers\n- Impact of macroeconomic factors\n- Future growth projections\n- Risk mitigation strategies\n\"\"\"\n\n    with open('/outputs/stock_analysis_script.md', 'w') as f:\n        f.write(script_content)\n    \n    print(\"Presenter script saved as stock_analysis_script.md\")\n\n# Main execution\ndef main():\n    print(\"Starting Stock Analysis...\")\n    \n    # Generate sample data\n    print(\"Generating sample stock data...\")\n    stock_data = generate_stock_data()\n    \n    # Save raw data\n    stock_data.to_csv('/outputs/stock_data_raw.csv', index=False)\n    print(\"Raw data saved as stock_data_raw.csv\")\n    \n    # Clean data\n    cleaned_data = clean_stock_data(stock_data)\n    \n    # Save cleaned data\n    cleaned_data.to_csv('/outputs/stock_cleaned.csv', index=False)\n    print(\"Cleaned data saved as stock_cleaned.csv\")\n    \n    # Create visualizations\n    analyzed_data = create_visualizations(cleaned_data)\n    \n    # Create presentation\n    create_presentation()\n    \n    # Create presenter script\n    create_presenter_script()\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\n    print(\"ANALYSIS COMPLETE\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n    print(\"Generated files:\")\n    print(\"- stock_data_raw.csv (original data)\")\n    print(\"- stock_cleaned.csv (cleaned data)\")\n    print(\"- Multiple visualization PNG files\")\n    print(\"- stock_analysis.pptx (presentation)\")\n    print(\"- stock_analysis_script.md (presenter script)\")\n    print(\"\\nAll files saved to /outputs/ directory\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n",

Today I'll present our comprehensive stock analysis covering the past two years of performance data.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 2: Closing Prices Over Time\\n\\\"This chart shows our stock's closing price trend. We can observe the overall upward trajectory with some expected market volatility. Key points to note are the steady growth periods and the resilience during market corrections.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 3: Moving Average Analysis\\n\\\"Here we see the closing price with 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The 50-day MA tracks short-term trends while the 200-day MA shows long-term direction. The consistent positioning of the 50-day above the 200-day indicates sustained bullish momentum.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 4: Variable Correlation Analysis\\n\\\"The correlation matrix reveals expected strong relationships between different price variables. Of particular interest is the relationship between volume and price movements, which shows moderate correlation suggesting healthy trading activity.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 5: Daily Return Distribution & Risk\\n\\\"This distribution of daily returns helps us understand the stock's risk profile. While most returns cluster around zero, we see the characteristic fat tails common in equity markets. This informs our risk management strategies.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 6: Trading Volume Analysis\\n\\\"Volume analysis shows consistent trading interest with periodic spikes. These volume surges often correspond to earnings announcements or market-moving events, indicating efficient price discovery.\\\"\\n\\n## Slide 7: Key Findings & Recommendations\\n\\\"In summary, our analysis reveals:\\n- Strong long-term growth trajectory\\n- Healthy technical indicators\\n- Manageable risk profile\\n- Sustained market interest\\n\\nWe recommend continued strategic investment with regular monitoring of these key metrics.\\\"\\n\\n## Q&A Preparation\\nBe prepared to discuss:\\n- Specific volatility events\\n- Comparison with industry peers\\n- Impact of macroeconomic factors\\n- Future growth projections\\n- Risk mitigation strategies\\n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    with open('/outputs/stock_analysis_script.md', 'w') as f:\\n        f.write(script_content)\\n    \\n    print(\\\"Presenter script saved as stock_analysis_script.md\\\")\\n\\n# Main execution\\ndef main():\\n    print(\\\"Starting Stock Analysis...\\\")\\n    \\n    # Generate sample data\\n    print(\\\"Generating sample stock data...\\\")\\n    stock_data = generate_stock_data()\\n    \\n    # Save raw data\\n    stock_data.to_csv('/outputs/stock_data_raw.csv', index=False)\\n    print(\\\"Raw data saved as stock_data_raw.csv\\\")\\n    \\n    # Clean data\\n    cleaned_data = clean_stock_data(stock_data)\\n    \\n    # Save cleaned data\\n    cleaned_data.to_csv('/outputs/stock_cleaned.csv', index=False)\\n    print(\\\"Cleaned data saved as stock_cleaned.csv\\\")\\n    \\n    # Create visualizations\\n    analyzed_data = create_visualizations(cleaned_data)\\n    \\n    # Create presentation\\n    create_presentation()\\n    \\n    # Create presenter script\\n    create_presenter_script()\\n    \\n    print(\\\"\\\\n\\\" + \\\"=\\\"*50)\\n    print(\\\"ANALYSIS COMPLETE\\\")\\n    print(\\\"=\\\"*50)\\n    print(\\\"Generated files:\\\")\\n    print(\\\"- stock_data_raw.csv (original data)\\\")\\n    print(\\\"- stock_cleaned.csv (cleaned data)\\\")\\n    print(\\\"- Multiple visualization PNG files\\\")\\n    print(\\\"- stock_analysis.pptx (presentation)\\\")\\n    print(\\\"- stock_analysis_script.md (presenter script)\\\")\\n    print(\\\"\\\\nAll files saved to /outputs/ directory\\\")\\n\\nif __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n    main()\\n\"}",

Today I'll present our comprehensive stock analysis covering the past two years of performance data.\"\n+\n+## Slide 2: Closing Prices Over Time\n+\"This chart shows our stock's closing price trend. We can observe the overall upward trajectory with some expected market volatility. Key points to note are the steady growth periods and the resilience during market corrections.\"\n+\n+## Slide 3: Moving Average Analysis\n+\"Here we see the closing price with 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The 50-day MA tracks short-term trends while the 200-day MA shows long-term direction. The consistent positioning of the 50-day above the 200-day indicates sustained bullish momentum.\"\n+\n+## Slide 4: Variable Correlation Analysis\n+\"The correlation matrix reveals expected strong relationships between different price variables. Of particular interest is the relationship between volume and price movements, which shows moderate correlation suggesting healthy trading activity.\"\n+\n+## Slide 5: Daily Return Distribution & Risk\n+\"This distribution of daily returns helps us understand the stock's risk profile. While most returns cluster around zero, we see the characteristic fat tails common in equity markets. This informs our risk management strategies.\"\n+\n+## Slide 6: Trading Volume Analysis\n+\"Volume analysis shows consistent trading interest with periodic spikes. These volume surges often correspond to earnings announcements or market-moving events, indicating efficient price discovery.\"\n+\n+## Slide 7: Key Findings & Recommendations\n+\"In summary, our analysis reveals:\n+- Strong long-term growth trajectory\n+- Healthy technical indicators\n+- Manageable risk profile\n+- Sustained market interest\n+\n+We recommend continued strategic investment with regular monitoring of these key metrics.\"\n+\n+## Q&A Preparation\n+Be prepared to discuss:\n+- Specific volatility events\n+- Comparison with industry peers\n+- Impact of macroeconomic factors\n+- Future growth projections\n+- Risk mitigation strategies\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+    with open('/outputs/stock_analysis_script.md', 'w') as f:\n+        f.write(script_content)\n+\n+    print(\"Presenter script saved as stock_analysis_script.md\")\n+\n+# Main execution\n+def main():\n+    print(\"Starting Stock Analysis...\")\n+\n+    # Generate sample data\n+    print(\"Generating sample stock data...\")\n+    stock_data = generate_stock_data()\n+\n+    # Save raw data\n+    stock_data.to_csv('/outputs/stock_data_raw.csv', index=False)\n+    print(\"Raw data saved as stock_data_raw.csv\")\n+\n+    # Clean data\n+    cleaned_data = clean_stock_data(stock_data)\n+\n+    # Save cleaned data\n+    cleaned_data.to_csv('/outputs/stock_cleaned.csv', index=False)\n+    print(\"Cleaned data saved as stock_cleaned.csv\")\n+\n+    # Create visualizations\n+    analyzed_data = create_visualizations(cleaned_data)\n+\n+    # Create presentation\n+    create_presentation()\n+\n+    # Create presenter script\n+    create_presenter_script()\n+\n+    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\n+    print(\"ANALYSIS COMPLETE\")\n+    print(\"=\"*50)\n+    print(\"Generated files:\")\n+    print(\"- stock_data_raw.csv (original data)\")\n+    print(\"- stock_cleaned.csv (cleaned data)\")\n+    print(\"- Multiple visualization PNG files\")\n+    print(\"- stock_analysis.pptx (presentation)\")\n+    print(\"- stock_analysis_script.md (presenter script)\")\n+    print(\"\\nAll files saved to /outputs/ directory\")\n+\n+if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n+    main()\n+",
